The reduction of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades are essential as we strive to reduce the global impacts of climate change and poor air quality. Effective policy decisions to reduce emissions rely on accurate, up-to-date information on the location and magnitude of the different sources. My research broadly works on the direct quantify emissions of the key contributing atmopsheric species to these global problems and subsequent verification of current emissions datasets informing abatement strategies. I use state of the art instrumentation for in-field measurements of atmospheric concentrations in combination with various mathematical techniques to calculate emissions at high spatial and temporal resolution. This involves the measurement of surface atmosphere exchange via eddy covariance using tower (temporal) and aircraft (spatial) platforms as well as mobile laboratories for source speciation and emission factor calculation. I have also worked on carbon footprint calculation for the University of York through extensive data collation and analysis.
