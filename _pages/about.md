I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California Berkeley.

Previously I conducted my doctoral and undergraduate studies in the Department of Chemistry at the University of York, with a masters year at the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM). 

My research aims to tackle the global issues of air quality and climate change with a focus on the spatial quantification of emissions data via surface-atmosphere exchange and mobile monitoring.
