I am a postdoc in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California Berkeley spanning the [Goldstein](https://nature.berkeley.edu/ahg/) and [Apte](https://apte.berkeley.edu/) research groups. I have a background in atmospheric chemistry and recently completed my Ph.D at the University of York. 

My research involves studying emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants in the fight against climate change and poor air quality. Although the negative consequences of these chemical species are directly related to their atmospheric concentration, most policy strategies aim to reduce the concentration or the rate of increase of concentration via the reduction of emissions. The policy decision making process requires accurate, up-to-date data on the magnitude and location of each emission source for the determination of an effective abatement strategy. I combine measurements and theory to directly quantify emissions of these important atmospheric species with a focus on sources with the greatest uncertainty. Specifically, I use state of the art [instrumentation](research) for in-field measurements of atmospheric concentrations in combination with various mathematical techniques to calculate emissions at high spatial and temporal resolution. This involves the measurement of [surface atmosphere exchange](research) via eddy covariance using tower (temporal) and aircraft (spatial) platforms as well as the calculation of [emission factors and source characterisation](research) using mobile laboratory measurements. I have also worked on [carbon footprint calculation](research) for the University of York through extensive data collation and analysis.

For more details and examples of my work, please see the [Research](research) and [Publications](publications) sections.
