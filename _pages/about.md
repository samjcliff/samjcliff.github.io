I am a postdoc in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California Berkeley spanning the [Goldstein](https://nature.berkeley.edu/ahg/) and [Apte](https://apte.berkeley.edu/) research groups. I have a background in atmospheric chemistry and recently completed my Ph.D at the University of York. 

### Education

* Ph.D in Chemistry
  * University of York (2020-2023)
  * Thesis title: *Understanding evolving urban air pollution sources with emissions measurement applications.*
* Master of Chemistry (First class honours with distinction)
  * Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (2019-2020)
  * University of York (2016-2020)
  * Thesis title: *Characterisation of VUV fluorescence and mid IR OA-ICOS for their suitability for airborne atmospheric measurement of carbon monoxide.*

## Research motivation
Two of the major global environmental challenges that we face today are reducing the impact of poor air quality and climate change. The negative consequences of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are directly related to their atmospheric concentration. However, most policy strategies aim to reduce the concentration or the rate of increase of concentration via the reduction of emissions. For effective abatement strategies to be introduced, accurate, up-to-date emissions data on the magnitude and location of each source is required. 

## What do I do?
I combine measurements and theory to directly quantify emissions of these important atmospheric species with a focus on sources with the greatest uncertainty. Specifically, I use state of the art [instrumentation](research) for in-field measurements of atmospheric concentrations in combination with various mathematical techniques to calculate emissions at high spatial and temporal resolution. This involves the measurement of [surface atmosphere exchange](research) via eddy covariance using tower and aircraft platforms as well as the calculation of [emission factors and source characterisation](research) using mobile laboratory measurements. I have also worked on [carbon footprint calculation](research) for the University of York through extensive data collation and analysis.
