I am a postdoc in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California Berkeley where I span the [Goldstein](https://nature.berkeley.edu/ahg/) and [Apte](https://apte.berkeley.edu/) research groups. 


Previously, I conducted my doctoral (2020-2023) and undergraduate (2016-2020) studies in the Department of Chemistry at the University of York, with a Master's year away the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) (2019-2020). My research is typically under the atmopsheric science banner in which I aim to contribute to the global issues of poor air quality and climate change. Specifically, I use and develop methodology for the quantification of emissions of atmospheric species which feedback into more accurate and effective policy abatement strategies. For more information, please see the Research section. 


For examples of my work, please see the [Research](talks) and [Publications](publications) sections.
