@article{barker-ch4-wetlands,
	abstract = {Arctic wetlands and surrounding ecosystems are both a significant source of methane (CH4) and a sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) during summer months. However, precise quantification of this regional CH4 source and CO2 sink remains poorly characterized. A research flight using the UK Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurement was conducted in July 2019 over an area (approx. 78 000 km2) of mixed peatland and forest in northern Sweden and Finland. Area-averaged fluxes of CH4 and carbon dioxide were calculated using an aircraft mass balance approach. Net CH4 fluxes normalized to wetland area ranged between 5.93 $\pm$ 1.87 mg m−2 h−1 and 4.44 $\pm$ 0.64 mg m−2 h−1 (largest to smallest) over the region with a meridional gradient across three discrete areas enclosed by the flight survey. From largest to smallest, net CO2 sinks ranged between −513 $\pm$ 74 mg m−2 h−1 and −284 $\pm$ 89 mg m−2 h−1 and result from net uptake of CO2 by vegetation and soils in the biosphere. A clear gradient of decreasing bulk and area-averaged CH4 flux was identified from north to south across the study region, correlated with decreasing peat bog land area from north to south identified from CORINE land cover classifications. While N2O mole fraction was measured, no discernible gradient was measured over the flight track, but a minimum flux threshold using this mass balance method was calculated. Bulk (total area) CH4 fluxes determined via mass balance were compared with area-weighted upscaled chamber fluxes from the same study area and were found to agree well within measurement uncertainty. The mass balance CH4 fluxes were found to be significantly higher than the CH4 fluxes reported by many land-surface process models compiled as part of the Global Carbon Project. There was high variability in both flux distribution and magnitude between the individual models. This further supports previous studies that suggest that land-surface models are currently ill-equipped to accurately capture carbon fluxes inthe region. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Rising methane: is warming feeding warming? (part\&nbsp;2)'. },

@article{lee-o3-wildfire,
	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone (O3) negatively impacts human health and is also a greenhouse gas. It is formed photochemically by reactions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs){,} of which wildfires are an important source. This study presents data from research flights sampling wildfires in West and Central African savannah regions{,} both close to the fires and after the emissions had been transported several days over the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. Emission factors (EFs) in g kg−1 for NOx (as NO){,} six VOCs and formaldehyde were calculated from enhancement to mole fractions in data taken close to the fires. For NOx{,} the emission factor was calculated as 2.05 $\pm$ 0.43 g kg−1 for Senegal and 1.20 $\pm$ 0.28 g kg−1 for Uganda{,} both higher than the average value of 1.13 $\pm$ 0.6 g kg−1 for previous studies of African savannah regions. For most VOCs (except acetylene){,} EFs in Uganda were lower by factors of 20--50% compared to Senegal{,} with almost all the values below those in the literature. O3 enhancement in the fire plumes was investigated by examining the ΔO3/ΔCO enhancement ratio{,} with values ranging from 0.07--0.14 close to the fires up to 0.25 for measurements taken over the Atlantic Ocean up to 200 hours downwind. In addition{,} measurements of O3 and its precursors were compared to the output of a global chemistry transport model (GEOS-CF) for the flights over the Atlantic Ocean. Normalised mean bias (NMB) comparison between the measured and modelled data was good outside of the fire plumes{,} with CO showing a model under-prediction of 4.6% and O3 a slight over-prediction of 0.7% (both within the standard deviation of the data). For NOx the agreement was poorer{,} with an under-prediction of 9.9% across all flights. Inside the fire plumes the agreement between modelled and measured values is worse{,} with the model being biased significantly lower for all three species. In total across all flights{,} there was an under-prediction of 29.4%{,} 16.5% and 37.5% for CO{,} O3 and NOx respectively. Finally{,} the measured ΔO3/ΔCO enhancement ratios were compared to those in the model for the equivalent flight data{,} with the model showing a lower value of 0.17 $\pm$ 0.03 compared to an observed value of 0.29 $\pm$ 0.05. The results detailed here show that the O3 burden to the North Atlantic Ocean from African wildfires may be underestimated and that further study is required to better study the O3 precursor emissions and chemistry.},
